# Data Integration and Classification Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates data integration from multiple sources and applies classification techniques using machine learning and deep learning models. The dataset was generated randomly for testing purposes and includes structured data from CSV, Excel, and JSON files.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Data is gathered from multiple sources:
   - `iris_main.csv`: Contains core features of the Iris dataset.
   - `iris_specs.xlsx`: Provides additional specifications for each species.
   - `iris_conditions.json`: Includes environmental conditions for the species.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, merging, and transforming the data to prepare it for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding patterns and relationships within the dataset through visualization and statistical methods.

4. **Model Development**:
   - Machine Learning models are trained to classify iris species.
   - Deep Learning models are implemented to enhance classification accuracy.

5. **Evaluation**: Model performance is assessed using accuracy metrics and visualization techniques.
